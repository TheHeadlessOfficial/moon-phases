# Conky Moon Phases
 
A standalone conky (written in Python) that shows the moon phases, using [moongiant.com](https://www.moongiant.com/) website.<br>
Based on https://gitlab.com/teobigusgeekus/Moongiant_conky_script<br>
<br>
<br>

## **WIKI**<br>

Download the .zip file, extract the files, copy the file `.conkyrc_moonpy` and the folder `.conky` inside your Linux `home`.<br>
Go to `/home/YOURHOMENAME/.conky/moon/Moongiant_python/font` and install the font.<br>
If your `home` is named *pippo*, copy inside *pippo* so you get: `/home/pippo/.conky` and `/home/pippo/.conkyrc_moonpy`<br>
Go to `/home/YOURHOMENAME/.conky/moon/Moongiant_python` and open with a text editor the file `moongiantpy.py`, go to line 17 and edit your emisphere.<br>
<br>
The python script saves data in files so you can build your conky moon as you wish, modifying the `.conkyrc_moonpy` i attach.<br>
Run the file `.conkyrc_moonpy` from terminal (the first time you run this conky), so you can get possible errors.
